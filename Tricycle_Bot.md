The Tricycle Bot is a easy-to-assemble and Grove_Compatible DIY Robot platform for education. It includes the eletronic materials and structure materials which could be assembled easily via the guideline. The Tricycle Bot has three floors and five shores between the 2nd and 3th floor, the 3th floor can be fixed many modules via screws and nuts.

Further more, you can fix the Arduino board and breadboard as the heart of the robot in the 2nd floor and each shore can be fixed 1-2 plug-n-play Grove modules as the wings of the robot to strengthen the functions accordingly, such as RGB LEd and ultrasonic Grove module. The supply voltage of Tricycle Bot is provided by a 12V battery holder.

##Platform Recommendation


You could fix any boards you like on Tricycle Bot to drive this Robot Platform, such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi and BeagleBone. And to drive the DC motors and Grove modules, motor cape and Grove cape are good helper for you.

As there are so many boards to choose, here we will make a introduction of how to choose the suitable board for you between Arduino, Raspberry and BeagleBone. 


###Arduino Platform

Arduino is the most famous open-source prototyping platform as its easy-to-use hardware and software. We believe that you could DIY a funny and creative robot car with Arduino easily. And as we have so much Grove modules for Arduino, it is convenient to expand function for your robot car, such as LED effect, obstacle detection or remote control(RF/Bluetooth/Wi-Fi).


####[Seeeduino V4.2](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-V4.2-p-2517.html)
Seeeduino v4 is an Open Source, Arduino-compatible ATmega328 MCU development board. We think Seeeduino v4 is one of the best Arduino derivatives/compatibles available. Seeeduino v4 is feature rich, much more stable, easy-to-use and even good looking.

- This demo Tricycle Bot car is able to detect the obstacle before it, and make a turn when their distances are less than 35CM.
- When the car goes straight, the LED strip will flash in blue，while the car is making a turn, the LED strip will flash in red and the Grove Buzzer will make a noise to warn.

###Coding

- Download the Arduino Library of [Motor Shield V2](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/SeeedMotorShieldV2), [Grove - Ultrasonic Ranger](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_Ultrasonic_Ranger) and [LED Strip](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel).
